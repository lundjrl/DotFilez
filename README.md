# ZSH
~
Config file for my personal terminal setup. 
~
I use iTerm2 instead of Terminal with Nerd Fonts as the font language. 
~
I also use POWERLEVEL9K (insert Vegeta meme here) and Oh-My-Zsh to achieve the layout that is. 
~
Happy Hacking :)

# VIM

Config for vim

I use nerdtree for a tree of directories and files on my machine and the anderson colorscheme
